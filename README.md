- I’m Benjamin Strope
- I’m interested in bioinformatics, data science, and eventually machine learning
- I am currently learning genetics/genomics through a master's program and learning Python in my free time
- I have only begun recently, so most of the work is at the novice/intermediate phase
- I’m currently learning bayesian statistics and statistical learning.
I will begin masters level thesis research on mRNA sequencing, tcRNA sequencing, and identifying new neoantigens in cancer cells for antibody/drug development purposes
